# node-grouping-test
A coding challenge for a Platform Engineer.

This repo contains the instructions and template to complete a coding challenge in Python. It is aimed at Python programmers of mid-level experience and up, and is designed to test the programmer's skill in designing and implementing algorithms. 

No external libraries are required—however, due to the algorithmic/numerical nature of the code at hand, Python libraries that provide robust implementations of various mathematical or statistical algorithms might be useful. The programmer should feel free to calibrate their approach to their own experience level. 

This repo contains two Python modules, `test.py` and `utils.py`. `utils.py` contains 1 helper function and 1 sample data structure to be used in completing the exercise. The programmer should work in `test.py`. It's a working Python module, that contains instructions as well as a few function definitions to be filled in. When the module is run from the command line (using `python test.py`), the `__main__` block will be executed, printing the output of the functions on the sample data.

While the output of the module will of course be inspected for correctness and adherence to the specs, the code itself will be reviewed for correctness and flexibility. The programmer is strongly encouraged to use the output of the command line as a smoke test that their code is constructed correctly, but *not* as the sole criterion for a working and effective implementation of the requirements. The programmer should feel free to include additional tests in whatever testing framework they're comfortable with, if desired.

The programmer is welcome to solve this challenge in either Python 2 or 3.
